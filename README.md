# Using `xinmodsjs`

This repository contains a very tiny application that reads a set of articles from a XIN Mods enhanced, Hippo CMS instance.

It has been created to show at a very rudimentary level how to use the `xinmods` NPM package.

It demonstrates:

* how to retrieve a list of documents;
* how to retrieve a single document;
* how to retrieve images and manipulate them.

For more information on how to setup XIN Mods as your CaaS backend, start here:

* [Getting Started](https://xinsolutions.co.nz/xinmods/getting-started) 

The repository also contains a package which should be imported into the XIN Mods backend to allow this 
tutorial to work properly. For instructions on how to do that, go here:

* [Using the package manager](https://xinsolutions.co.nz/xinmods/package-manager)
 
This is by no means an instruction on how to best structure your frontend codebase.
